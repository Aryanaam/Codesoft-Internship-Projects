Codesoft Internship Projects

This repository contains my Codesoft Internship projects, showcasing my work on machine learning, data analysis, and web-based applications. Each project demonstrates real-world applications of Python, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

Projects Overview
Task 1: Sales Prediction (Python & Machine Learning)

Description:
For Task 1, I developed a sales prediction model to forecast product sales based on historical advertising and sales data. The project focuses on analyzing trends, building regression models, and visualizing insights for better business decision-making.

Key Features:

Predict future sales based on advertising data

Analyze relationships between advertising channels and sales

Visualizations: Sales trends, channel impact analysis

Technologies Used:

Python, pandas, numpy

scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Task 2: SuperStore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

Description:
Task 2 involved building an interactive Power BI dashboard using SuperStore sales data. The dashboard helps visualize sales performance across regions, products, and categories, providing insights for strategic business planning.

Key Features:

Interactive sales and profit analysis by region, category, and product

Trend analysis and key metrics visualization

Filters and slicers for dynamic reporting

Technologies Used:

Power BI

Data cleaning and transformation techniques

Task 3: IMDb Movie Rating Predictor (Python & Gradio)

Description:
For Task 3, I created an interactive web application that predicts IMDb ratings for movies based on inputs like genre, director, actors, and release year. The project also provides visual insights to understand trends in the dataset.

Key Features:

Predict IMDb ratings using a trained Random Forest Regressor

Visualizations: Rating distribution, genre analysis, top directors

Interactive web app using Gradio

Technologies Used:

Python, pandas, numpy

scikit-learn (Random Forest Regression)

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Gradio for web app interface

Project Link: IMDb Movie Rating Predictor GitHub
